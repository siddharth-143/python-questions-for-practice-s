"""
Question 85 :
    By using list comprehension, write a program to print the list
    after removing the 0th, 4th,5th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].

    Hints : Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of elements from
    a list. Use enumerate() to get (index, values) tuple.
"""

# Solution :

li = [12, 24, 35, 70, 88, 120, 155]
li = [x for (i, x) in enumerate(li) if i not in (0, 4, 5)]
print(li)

"""
Output :
    [24, 35, 70, 155]
