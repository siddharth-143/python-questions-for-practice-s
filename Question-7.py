"""
Question 7 :
    Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and
    generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the
    i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
    Note: i=0,1....,X-1: j = 0,1,iY-1. Example suppose the following
    input are given to the program 3,5 Then, the output of the program
    should be:[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4],[1,2,4,6,8]]

    Hints: Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question,
    it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form
"""

# Solution :

num1 = int(input("Enter a number of rows : "))
num2 = int(input("Enter a number of columns : "))

dimensions = [int(x) for x in (num1,num2)]
row_num = dimensions[0]
column_num = dimensions[1]
multi_list = [[0 for col in range(column_num)] for row in range(row_num)]

for row in range(row_num):
    for col in range(column_num):
        multi_list[row][col] = row*col

print(multi_list)

"""
Output : 
    Enter a number of rows : 3
    Enter a number of columns : 5
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
