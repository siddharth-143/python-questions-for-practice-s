# Solution :

sentence = input("Enter a string : ")
dic = {"UPPER CASE " : 0, "LOWER CASE" : 0}
for i in sentence:
    if i.isupper():
        dic["UPPER CASE "] += 1
    elif i.islower():
        dic["LOWER CASE"] += 1
    else:
        pass

print("UPPER CASE : ", dic["UPPER CASE "])
print("LOWER CASE : ", dic["LOWER CASE"])
