"""
Question 22 :
    Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the
    input. The output should output after sorting the keys alphanumerically.
    Suppose the following input is supplied to the program : New to Python
    or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
    Then, the output should be : 2:2 3.:1 3?: New:1 Python:5 Read:1 and:1 between:1
    choosing:1 or:2 to:1

    Hints : In case of input data being supplied to the question,
    it should be assumed to be a console input.
"""

# Solution :

freq = {}  # Frequency of words in text
line = input("Enter the input : ")
for words in line.split():
    freq[words] = freq.get(words, 0) + 1

words = freq.keys()
words.sort()

for w in words:
    print("%s:%d" % (w, freq[w]))
