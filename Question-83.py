"""
Question 83 :
    By using list comprehension, write a program to print
    the list after removing the 0th, 2nd, 4th, 6th numbers in
    [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].

    Hints : Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of elements
    from a list.Use enumerate() to get (index values) tuple.
"""

# Solution :

li = [12, 24, 35, 70, 88, 120, 155]
li = [x for (x,i) in enumerate(li) if i % 2 != 0]
print(li)

"""
Output : 
    [2, 6]
