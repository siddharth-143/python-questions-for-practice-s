Question 10 :
    Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace
    separated words as input and prints rhe words after removing
    all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
    Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

    Then, the output should be : again hello world makes perfect practice
    world

    Hints : In case of input data being supplied to the question,
    it should be assumed to be a console input.We use set container
    to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted()
    to sort the data.
